# AnarchyExploitFixes

Fix exploits on a Minecraft Anarchy Server

[![bstats](https://bstats.org/signatures/bukkit/AnarchyExploitFixes.svg)](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/AnarchyExploitFixes/8700)

## Requirements

* ProtocolLib - This is for preventing packet exploits, if it's not present these exploits will not be prevented.

## Prebuilt jar

Go to releases, download the latest jar
<br> If you wish to have a prebuilt BETA jar with the latest code, click Actions at the top of the page, click the
latest build, and download the artifact.

## Building from source

`git clone https://github.com/moom0o/AnarchyExploitFixes.git`

Run `mvn package`

## Servers using AEF:

Add your server in a pull request

constantiam.net (70-80), 5b5t.org (50-150), openanarchy.org (40-150), 1b1t.me (5-20), scfanarchy.ggs.gg (0-3)

## Commands

These commands are only able to be executed by console or opped players.

* /aef ver - Plugin version.
* /aef reload - Reload the config
* /aef kickphrase (phrase) - Kick all players that have said these words. Currently broken will fix when feel like it.
* /aef geared - See how many players have armor or are new.
* /aef elytra - See who is flying on an elytra.
* /aef lag - artificially lag the server for testing. Every time you run the command the server freezes for 1 second by
  default, add milliseconds to the end of the command for custom time.

## Contact

Need to let me know of any exploits in private? Contact me on discord: `moo#0529` or email `moom0o@protonmail.com`

## Notice

Please note that some exploits already patched
by [2LS ExploitFixer](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/2ls-exploitfixer-the-ultimate-antiexploit-plugin.62842/)
& [Papaya (My paper fork)](https://github.com/moom0o/Papaya) are probably not fixed in AEF, I recommend using those 2
alongside AEF to patch the majority of exploits.

## Features

**This list does not include all features, check the config for all features!**

**All features listed here can be disabled or enabled in the config.**

* Prevent NoCom exploit. - Prevent the 'NoCom' coordinate exploit
* Prevent BowBomb exploit. - Prevent an exploit where bows can instantly kill a player.
* Prevent burrow hack - Where you step inside a block so crystals can't do any damage.
* Prevent boatfly exploit - Prevent the futureclient/rusherhack boatfly exploit.
* Prevent book-ban - All characters still work! The size of each page is just limited to 255 bytes (customizable). This
  allows to fill the whole page with latin characters. Characters that use more bytes such as Chinese may be limited in
  length.
* Prevent unbreakable packet elytra fly.
* Prevent packet fly exploit.
* Prevent end gateway crash exploit. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5nVBQeYo-I
* Patch end portal dupe. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLvErqzeK3Y
* Prevent Y256 dispenser crash exploit. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL17P87O6xA
* Anti-illegal system. - Automatically remove illegal items, stacked items, high enchanted items, unenchantable items,
  and items in shulkers.
* Limit speed of snowballs to prevent clientside lag.
* Limit crafting table autorecipe speed to prevent a lag exploit.
* Prevent all coordinate exploits related to teleporting by vanishing a player right before they are teleported.
* Prevent destroying end portal frames.
* Prevent multiple end dragons from being created.
* Prevent portal traps - Disabled by default.
* Automatically fill in the bedrock floor/roof if the bedrock has been broken.
* Prevent players from going below the bedrock floor by teleporting them up. - Useful so people can't elytra fly below
  the world.

  example, from a backdoor.
* Limit falling blocks per chunk to prevent lag.
* Limit exp bottles per chunk to prevent lag.
* Prevent projectiles from going through portals, shooting projectiles through portals can get them stuck in the same
  place on the other side, once they are loaded the server can crash.
